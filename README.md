# :pineapple: :grapes: Better Diet to fight Covid-19 :banana: :watermelon:
Using Machine Learning, We try to analyse the food consumpotions from countries all over the world to see wether there's a relationship between a given country food habits and their recovery rate.

## Dataset
Data is gathered by this fantastic Kagggler [Maria Ren](https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset).  Data is divided into four datasets, they all have the same 170 rows, which are all countries, and same columns, which are 23 different food categories and COVID-19 statistics for each country. All four datasets share the same values of the columns of COVID-19 statistics for each country, the difference between them is explained as follows:-
* Fat Supply Quantity Data:-
    for each country, it demonstrates the fat consumption percentages distributed amongst all food categories. 
* Food Supply Quantity in Kg:- 
    for each country, it demonstrates the food supply quantity consumption percentages distributed amongst all food categories. 
* Protein Supply Quantity Data:-
    for each country, it demonstrates the protein consumption percentages distributed amongst all food categories. 
* Food Supply Data in Kcal:-
    for each country, it demonstrates the energy intake consumption percentages distributed amongst all food categories.
